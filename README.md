# LEDSFYS

_LED Strip From Your Sofa_ is a personal project that eases the use of custom made LED Strip at home. With my collaborator [@art049](https://github.com/art049) we built an API that makes it possible to dynamically change the colors of a LED strip (see our repo [MusicALeS](https://github.com/slak-bro/MusicALeS)). LEDSFYS adds a user interface to this API in order to easily switch the colors in your living room from your cellphone.

I'll soon make a small video and link it here to make that more understandable :)
